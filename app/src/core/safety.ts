- Individual patient factors may require modifications
- Local protocols and institutional guidelines take precedence
- Tool accuracy depends on correct data input

PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY:
- Patient care decisions remain the responsibility of qualified healthcare providers
- Clinical judgment and medical training are irreplaceable
- Always consult appropriate specialists when available
- Verify all calculations with multiple sources
