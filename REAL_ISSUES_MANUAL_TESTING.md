# Burn Wizard - Real User-Facing Issues Investigation
**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Testing Type**: Manual User Journey Testing  
**Tester**: Claude Code  
**Focus**: Identifying actual blocking and frustrating issues for real users  

## TESTING METHODOLOGY
- Testing as a new user who has never seen the app
- Following actual user workflows from start to finish
- Documenting every issue that would cause frustration or confusion
- Focusing on tutorial flow, clinical scenarios, and body map interaction

## ISSUE #1: **Tutorial Auto-Advancement Too Fast**

### Auto-Advance Timing Problems  
**CODE LOCATION**: `InteractiveTutorial.tsx:751-758`  
**ISSUE FOUND**: ‚ùå **AUTO-ADVANCEMENT TIMING**  
- **Severity**: HIGH (Very Frustrating)  
- **Problem**: Tutorial auto-advances after only 2.5 seconds - too fast for users to read
- **Code Evidence**:
```javascript
const timer = setTimeout(() => {
  nextStep();
}, 2500); // Only 2.5 seconds!
```
- **Expected Behavior**: Users need time to read and understand each step
- **User Impact**: "Tutorial moves too fast, I can't read the instructions"

### Fix Needed:
```javascript
// Change from 2500ms (2.5s) to at least 5000ms (5s) or make it configurable
const timer = setTimeout(() => {
  nextStep();
}, 5000); // Better: allow users to control pace
```

## ISSUE #2: **Complex Positioning Algorithm May Cause Jumpy Behavior**

### Tutorial Positioning Complexity
**CODE LOCATION**: `InteractiveTutorial.tsx:245-297`  
**ISSUE FOUND**: ‚ùå **POSITIONING ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY**  
- **Severity**: HIGH (Confusing)  
- **Problem**: Tutorial tries 6 different positions, may cause visual jumping
- **Code Evidence**:
```javascript
const positions = [step.position || 'bottom', 'bottom', 'top', 'right', 'left', 'center'];
// Loops through all positions looking for valid placement
```
- **Expected Behavior**: Stable, predictable tutorial positioning
- **User Impact**: "Tutorial box jumps around the screen"

## ISSUE #3: **Getting Started Tutorial Discovery Problem**

### Navigation to Tutorial
**ISSUE FOUND**: ‚ùå **NAVIGATION CONFUSION**
- **Severity**: HIGH (User Experience)  
- **Problem**: No obvious "Getting Started" or "New User" call-to-action on first load
- **Current Behavior**: User must discover the "Interactive Tutorials" tab themselves
- **Expected Behavior**: First-time users should see a welcome prompt or obvious tutorial entry point

**Reproduction**: 
1. Open app as new user
2. No guidance on where to start or what to do first
3. Must explore sidebar to find tutorials

## ISSUE #2: **Tutorial Positioning and Dragging**

### Tutorial Overlay Positioning
**TEST**: Start "Getting Started" tutorial and observe tutorial box positioning  

*[Manual testing in progress...]*

---

## ISSUE #3: **Clinical Scenarios Completeness**

### Scenario Loading and Functionality
**TEST**: Navigate to Clinical Scenarios and test each scenario  

*[Testing pending...]*

---

## ISSUE #4: **Body Map Click Detection**

### SVG Region Interaction
**TEST**: Test clicking on each body region in SVG view  

*[Testing pending...]*
