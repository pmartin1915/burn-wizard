# Real User-Facing Issues Report - Burn Wizard
Generated: 2025-08-24 17:15
Investigation: Manual testing and code analysis based on Perry's feedback

## CRITICAL USER EXPERIENCE ISSUES FOUND ❌

### Issue #1: Tutorial Positioning System Broken
**Location**: `app/src/components/InteractiveTutorial.tsx:149-265`
**Description**: Tutorial overlay positioning fails in real usage scenarios
**User Impact**: Tutorial boxes appear off-screen, making the Getting Started experience unusable
**Problems Found**:
- Fixed dialog height assumption (400px) doesn't match actual content
- Position calculations don't handle viewport boundaries properly
- Transform logic fails when target elements are near screen edges
- No graceful fallback when elements are not found
**Status**: ❌ Critical - Breaks primary user onboarding

### Issue #2: Missing Data Attributes for Tutorial Targets
**Location**: Body map and patient info components
**Description**: Tutorial selectors reference non-existent data attributes
**User Impact**: Tutorial steps fail to highlight correct elements
**Missing Attributes**:
- `[data-region="Head"]` - Body map regions lack consistent data attributes
- `[data-element="patient-info"]` - Patient info container missing attribute
- `[data-element="body-map"]` - Body map container missing attribute
- `[data-field="burn-depth-selector"]` - Burn depth selector inconsistent
**Status**: ❌ Critical - Tutorial cannot target correct elements

### Issue #3: Clinical Scenarios Severely Incomplete
**Location**: `app/src/domain/clinicalScenarios.ts`
**Description**: Only 1 scenario exists, not the comprehensive library promised
**User Impact**: Medical education feature appears broken/unfinished
**Problems**:
- Only "pediatric-scald" scenario defined
- Missing adult, elderly, and special category scenarios
- UI promises multiple cases but delivers only one
- No advanced or intermediate difficulty scenarios
**Status**: ❌ High - Core educational feature incomplete

### Issue #4: Tutorial Step Validation Logic Flawed
**Location**: `app/src/domain/tutorialSteps.ts` validation functions
**Description**: Step progression logic fails to detect user completion
**User Impact**: Users get stuck on tutorial steps even after completing actions
**Problems**:
- Auto-advancement timing too aggressive (2500ms)
- Validation doesn't check actual DOM state
- Route navigation validation unreliable
- Click actions don't properly advance tutorial
**Status**: ❌ High - Tutorial becomes frustrating rather than helpful

---

## SECONDARY ISSUES (Still User-Facing)

### Issue #5: Interactive Elements Break During Tutorial
**Description**: Normal app functionality disabled during tutorial mode
**User Impact**: Users cannot actually use the app while learning it
**Location**: Tutorial overlay z-index and event handling
**Status**: ❌ Medium - Reduces tutorial effectiveness

### Issue #6: Mobile Tutorial Experience Poor
**Description**: Tutorial positioning calculations assume desktop viewport
**User Impact**: Tutorial unusable on mobile devices
**Location**: Responsive breakpoint calculations in positioning logic
**Status**: ❌ Medium - Excludes mobile users from onboarding

### Issue #7: Tutorial Content Refers to Non-Existent Features
**Description**: Tutorial mentions features like "Grid View" that don't exist
**User Impact**: Users get confused looking for features that aren't there
**Location**: Tutorial step content descriptions
**Status**: ❌ Medium - Creates user confusion

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Primary Problem: Automated Testing vs Real Usage
The comprehensive automated testing suite (83 tests, all passing core calculations) completely missed these user experience issues because:

1. **No E2E Testing**: Tests validate calculations but not user interactions
2. **No DOM Integration Tests**: Tutorial selectors never tested against actual DOM
3. **No Responsive Testing**: Mobile experience never validated
4. **No User Journey Testing**: Step-by-step user flows never verified

### Secondary Problem: Feature Incompleteness
- Clinical scenarios were started but never finished
- Tutorial system was built but never properly connected to actual UI elements
- Content refers to features that were planned but never implemented

---

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### User Experience Impact: **SEVERE**
- New users cannot complete onboarding tutorial
- Educational features appear broken/unfinished
- Mobile users cannot use key features
- Overall impression of incomplete/buggy application

### Medical Education Impact: **HIGH**
- Primary educational feature (clinical scenarios) severely limited
- Interactive learning (tutorial) non-functional
- Undermines credibility as educational tool

### Perry's Development Impact: **MEDIUM**
- User feedback indicates problems with core features
- Time spent on polished calculations while UX remained broken
- Need to prioritize user-facing fixes over technical perfection

---

## RECOMMENDED FIX PRIORITIES

### 1. IMMEDIATE (Fix Tonight)
1. Fix tutorial positioning system
2. Add missing data attributes to tutorial targets
3. Add 4-5 additional clinical scenarios (adult, elderly, special)
4. Test tutorial end-to-end on desktop and mobile

### 2. SHORT-TERM (Next Session)
1. Implement proper E2E testing
2. Add mobile-responsive tutorial positioning
3. Fix step validation logic
4. Add more advanced clinical scenarios

### 3. LONG-TERM
1. Complete grid view feature or remove references
2. Add comprehensive user journey testing
3. Implement tutorial progress persistence
4. Add scenario difficulty progression

---

## CONCLUSION

**The automated scan completely missed the real problems.** While the medical calculations are excellent, the user experience is broken in fundamental ways that prevent users from accessing those calculations effectively.

**Priority**: Fix user-facing issues FIRST, technical perfection SECOND.
