## Report Standards

### Test Report Template

Each test report should include:

1. **Test Information**
   - Test ID and name
   - Test objective
   - Test date and duration
   - Test environment
   - Testers and reviewers

2. **Test Execution**
   - Prerequisites met
   - Test steps executed
   - Actual results
   - Pass/fail status
   - Deviations noted

3. **Test Results Summary**
   - Overall test status
   - Success criteria met
   - Defects identified
   - Risk assessment
   - Recommendations

4. **Traceability**
   - Requirements covered
   - Design outputs verified
   - Risk controls validated

### Approval Requirements

All test reports require:
- [ ] Test execution sign-off
- [ ] Technical review approval
- [ ] Clinical review (for medical content tests)
- [ ] QA approval
- [ ] Project lead approval

## Test Execution Schedule

### Phase 1: Unit Testing (Week 1)
- [ ] Domain module unit tests
- [ ] Security function tests
- [ ] Validation logic tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (Week 2)  
- [ ] UI-domain integration
- [ ] Offline functionality
- [ ] Security integration
- [ ] Data persistence

### Phase 3: System Testing (Week 3)
- [ ] End-to-end workflows
- [ ] Clinical scenario testing
- [ ] Usability validation
- [ ] Performance under load

### Phase 4: Clinical Validation (Week 4)
- [ ] Emergency department scenarios
- [ ] Outpatient clinic workflows
- [ ] Patient education effectiveness
- [ ] Clinical SME review

## Quality Assurance

### Test Data Management
- Synthetic test data only (no real PHI)
- Version-controlled test cases
- Reproducible test scenarios
- Secure test data disposal

### Defect Management
- Critical: Immediate attention required
- High: Fix before next phase
- Medium: Fix before deployment
- Low: Document for future enhancement

### Review Process
1. Test execution by qualified testers
2. Initial review by test lead
3. Technical review by development team
4. Clinical review (where applicable)
5. Final approval by QA and project lead

## Regulatory Compliance

All test reports support:
- ISO 14971 risk management verification
- IEC 62304 software lifecycle compliance
- Medical device validation requirements
- Institutional deployment validation

## Document Control

- All reports versioned and change-controlled
- Electronic signatures for approvals
- Secure storage with access controls
- Regular backup and archival
