## Architecture

This application follows a clean domain-driven architecture:

- **Domain Layer** (`/src/domain/`): Pure TypeScript functions for all calculations
- **UI Layer** (`/src/components/`): React components with accessibility focus
- **State Management** (`/src/store/`): Zustand for type-safe state handling
- **Core Services** (`/src/core/`): PWA utilities and safety frameworks

For detailed architecture information, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Clinical Safety
